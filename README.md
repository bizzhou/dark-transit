# DarkTransit

This is a dark themed MTA bus time. I use a proxy server to provide the access the MTA BusTime API.


## Todo:
- Integrate Twillo to send SMS to user.
- Integrate Subway time.

## Development server

Run `node index.js` in nodeapi folder to start the proxy server.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
